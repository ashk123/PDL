# Description

        PDL is a small tool for downloading and installing packages, its not a package system
        its sub-package system
        (you can read more about it in sub-package system side)
        PDL can handle network, wtih git repository this feature that allows you
        to download any packages from internet with .pdl file, and patch it into the PDL database

        in client, when you want to update your pfl files, you can choose your repository
        for uploading, we must see all your installation commands,

# Why PDL ?

        PDL just created for reason to have a visual package downloader in LainOS
        we don't wanted to create a main packaging system like apt or any things like that
        we made a simple program for users that people can understand easily, 
        how package downloaders work
        you can use or not, its your choice, it's easy for work and install. 
        (check LainOS website for new updates)
